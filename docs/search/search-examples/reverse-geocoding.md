Sometimes you need to translate a coordinate into a human-readable street address. This is often
used in tracking applications that receive a GPS feed from a device or asset and need to obtain the
corresponding address. The reverse geocoding endpoint returns the address information described in
the Reverse Geocoding API documentation on the Developer Portal.
