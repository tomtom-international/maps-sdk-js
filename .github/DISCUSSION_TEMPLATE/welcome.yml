        ## 🚀 About the SDK
        
        TomTom Maps SDK for JavaScript is a powerful library for building applications using [TomTom location maps and services](https://docs.tomtom.com/). It leverages [MapLibre GL JS](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js) and [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) to seamlessly integrate TomTom maps and services.
        
        ### 📦 Three Main Packages
        
        - **Map** (`@tomtom-org/maps-sdk/map`) - MapLibre-powered interactive TomTom Maps (web only)
          - Different styles: light, dark, b&w, satellite
          - Configurable POIs and Live Traffic
          - Seamlessly integrable with TomTom Services
        
        - **Services** (`@tomtom-org/maps-sdk/services`) - Location APIs for all platforms
          - Compatible with web, Node.js, and React Native
          - GeoJSON services for places, routing, and geocoding
          - EV support for charging stations and long-distance routing
        
        - **Core** (`@tomtom-org/maps-sdk/core`) - Shared configuration, types, and utilities
          - Common configuration across Map and Services
          - TypeScript types for seamless integration
          - Utility functions for distance/duration formatting
