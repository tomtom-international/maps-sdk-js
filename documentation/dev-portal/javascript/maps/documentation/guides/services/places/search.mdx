# Search Services

The TomTom Maps SDK provides three powerful search services that help you find places, addresses, and points of interest with different search strategies optimized for various use cases. Each search type is designed to handle specific user interaction patterns and application requirements.

## Available Search Types

### Autocomplete Search

Perfect for search-as-you-type experiences with instant suggestions, autocomplete search provides real-time results as users type their queries. This service is optimized for speed and relevance, making it ideal for interactive search interfaces.

```javascript
import { autocompleteSearch } from '@cet/maps-sdk-js/services';

const suggestions = await autocompleteSearch({
    query: 'coffee',
    position: [4.9041, 52.3676] // Amsterdam
});
```

**Key Features:**
- **Real-time suggestions** as users type with minimal latency
- **Brand and category suggestions** for enhanced user experience
- **Optimized for speed** with lightweight responses
- **Perfect for search bars** and interactive input fields

**Best Use Cases:**
- Search-as-you-type functionality in web and mobile applications
- Quick location lookup in navigation interfaces
- Instant suggestions for booking and reservation systems

### Fuzzy Search

Comprehensive search that handles typos, variations in queries, and natural language input. Fuzzy search is robust and forgiving, making it ideal for situations where users might not know exact spellings or when dealing with international locations.

```javascript
import { search } from '@cet/maps-sdk-js/services';

const results = await search({
    query: 'coffe shop near dam square',  // Handles typos and variations
    position: [4.9041, 52.3676]
});
```

**Advanced Capabilities:**
- **Tolerates spelling mistakes** and variations in input
- **Supports natural language queries** for intuitive user interaction
- **Category and POI search** with intelligent matching
- **Flexible radius-based** or bounding box search options

**Ideal Applications:**
- General search functionality where user input quality varies
- International applications with diverse language inputs
- Voice-to-text search implementations

### Geometry Search

Find places within specific geographic boundaries or custom areas. Geometry search enables location discovery within precisely defined regions, making it perfect for area-specific applications and location-based services.

```javascript
import { search } from '@cet/maps-sdk-js/services';

// Search within a bounding box
const results = await search({
    query: 'restaurants',
    boundingBox: [4.7, 52.2, 5.1, 52.5] // Amsterdam area bounds
});
```

**Geometric Search Options:**
- **Custom geometric boundaries** using GeoJSON polygons
- **City and neighborhood-based searches** within administrative boundaries
- **Bounding box searches** for rectangular geographic areas
- **Radius-based circular searches** around specific points

**Perfect For:**
- Location discovery within specific neighborhoods or districts
- Delivery and service area applications
- Tourism and local business discovery

## Advanced Search Configuration

### Common Search Parameters

All search services share a consistent parameter structure that allows for fine-tuning results based on your application's requirements:

```javascript
const results = await search({
    query: 'restaurants',
    position: [longitude, latitude],     // Reference point for relevance
    limit: 10,                          // Maximum results (1-100)
    radius: 5000,                       // Search radius in meters
    categorySet: ['RESTAURANT'],        // Filter by POI categories
    countrySet: ['NL', 'DE']           // Restrict to specific countries
});
```

**Parameter Details:**
- **query**: The search term or natural language query
- **position**: Geographic reference point for result ranking and proximity
- **limit**: Controls result quantity for performance optimization
- **radius**: Defines search area scope in meters
- **categorySet**: Filters results by predefined POI categories
- **countrySet**: Restricts results to specific ISO country codes

### Working with Search Results

Search results follow a consistent GeoJSON structure that integrates seamlessly with mapping and visualization components:

```javascript
const results = await search({
    query: 'coffee',
    position: [4.9041, 52.3676]
});

results.results.forEach(place => {
    console.log(place.poi.name);                    // Business name
    console.log(place.address.freeformAddress);     // Complete address
    console.log(place.position);                    // [longitude, latitude]
    console.log(place.categories);                  // POI categories
});
```

## Integration with Map Visualization

Search results can be directly integrated with the TomTom Maps SDK for immediate visual representation:

```javascript
import { TomTomMap, PlacesModule } from '@cet/maps-sdk-js/map';

const map = new TomTomMap({ container: 'map' });
const placesModule = await PlacesModule.get(map);

const results = await search({
    query: 'museums',
    position: [4.9041, 52.3676]
});

// Display search results as markers on the map
placesModule.addPlaces({
    id: 'search-results',
    places: results.results
});
```

## Performance Optimization

For optimal performance in production applications, consider these best practices:

**Search Strategy Selection:**
- Use **autocomplete** for real-time search interfaces
- Use **fuzzy search** for comprehensive location finding
- Use **geometry search** for area-specific discovery

**Result Limiting:**
- Set appropriate `limit` values based on UI requirements
- Use pagination for large result sets
- Cache frequent search results for faster response times
