# Routing Services Quickstart Guide

The TomTom Routing Services in the Maps SDK provide powerful route calculation capabilities that integrate seamlessly with the [TomTom Routing API](https://developer.tomtom.com/routing-api/documentation/product-information/introduction). This comprehensive routing system calculates optimal routes between locations, supports various vehicle types, and incorporates real-time traffic data for accurate travel time estimates.

## Purpose and Capabilities

The Routing Services enable sophisticated navigation and logistics applications with these core capabilities:

- **Calculate optimal routes** between multiple waypoints with various optimization criteria (fastest, shortest, eco-friendly)
- **Support different vehicle types** including cars, trucks, motorcycles, and electric vehicles with specific routing constraints
- **Integrate real-time traffic** for accurate travel time estimates and dynamic route optimization
- **Handle complex routing scenarios** with intermediate stops, custom constraints, and delivery requirements
- **Provide turn-by-turn instructions** for navigation applications with detailed guidance information

## Core Routing Concepts

### Route Planning Process

The routing system follows a structured approach to route calculation:

1. **Define waypoints**: Specify origin, destination, and optional intermediate stops using coordinates
2. **Set optimization criteria**: Choose route type and travel preferences based on application needs
3. **Configure vehicle parameters**: Specify vehicle type and characteristics for accurate routing
4. **Apply constraints**: Set preferences for tolls, highways, ferries, and other road features
5. **Execute calculation**: Process the request and receive detailed route information with traffic data

### Route Data Structure

The routing service returns comprehensive route information including geometric path data, navigation instructions, route metrics, and alternative options when requested. This structured data enables both visualization and turn-by-turn navigation functionality.

## Prerequisites and Setup

### Basic Configuration

Configure your routing environment with the essential SDK setup:

```javascript
import { TomTomConfig } from '@cet/maps-sdk-js/core';
import { calculateRoute } from '@cet/maps-sdk-js/services';

TomTomConfig.instance.put({
    apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
});
```

### Node.js Environment Configuration

For server-side applications and backend services, configure routing with environment variables:

```javascript
const { calculateRoute } = require("@cet/maps-sdk-js/services");
const { TomTomConfig } = require("@cet/maps-sdk-js/core");

TomTomConfig.instance.put({
    apiKey: process.env.TOMTOM_API_KEY
});
```

## Basic Route Calculation

### Simple Point-to-Point Route

The most straightforward routing scenario involves calculating a route between two geographic points:

```javascript
const route = await calculateRoute({
    locations: [
        [4.9041, 52.3676], // Amsterdam coordinates
        [2.3522, 48.8566]  // Paris coordinates
    ]
});
```

### Route with Multiple Stops

For complex journeys involving multiple destinations, specify waypoints in the order they should be visited:

```javascript
const route = await calculateRoute({
    locations: [
        [4.9041, 52.3676], // Amsterdam (start)
        [3.7038, 51.2194], // Brussels (stop 1)
        [4.3517, 50.8503], // Liège (stop 2)
        [2.3522, 48.8566]  // Paris (end)
    ]
});
```

### Vehicle-Specific Route Optimization

Configure routing parameters based on specific vehicle characteristics for accurate route calculation:

```javascript
const route = await calculateRoute({
    locations: [
        [4.9041, 52.3676],
        [2.3522, 48.8566]
    ],
    vehicleEngineType: 'electric',
    vehicleWeight: 1600, // kg
    vehicleMaxSpeed: 90  // km/h
});
```

## Route Configuration Options

### Route Type Optimization

Choose the optimization strategy that best fits your application's requirements:

```javascript
const route = await calculateRoute({
    locations: [[4.9041, 52.3676], [2.3522, 48.8566]],
    routeType: 'fastest',    // Options: 'fastest', 'shortest', 'eco'
    traffic: true,           // Include real-time traffic data
    avoid: ['tollRoads'],    // Avoid specific road types
    departAt: 'now'          // Departure time for traffic optimization
});
```

**Route Type Options:**
- **fastest**: Minimizes travel time (default)
- **shortest**: Minimizes distance traveled
- **eco**: Optimizes for fuel efficiency and environmental impact

## Working with Route Results

### Accessing Route Information

Route responses contain detailed information for navigation and analysis:

```javascript
const route = await calculateRoute({
    locations: [
        [4.9041, 52.3676],
        [2.3522, 48.8566]
    ]
});

// Access route summary information
console.log(`Distance: ${route.routes[0].summary.lengthInMeters}m`);
console.log(`Duration: ${route.routes[0].summary.travelTimeInSeconds}s`);

// Extract coordinates for map visualization
const coordinates = route.routes[0].legs[0].points.map(point =>
    [point.longitude, point.latitude]
);
```

## Integration with Map Visualization

### Displaying Routes on Maps

Integrate calculated routes with the TomTom Maps SDK for immediate visual representation:

```javascript
import { TomTomMap, RoutesModule } from '@cet/maps-sdk-js/map';

const map = new TomTomMap({ container: 'map' });
const routesModule = await RoutesModule.get(map);

const route = await calculateRoute({
    locations: [
        [4.9041, 52.3676],
        [2.3522, 48.8566]
    ]
});

routesModule.addRoute({
    id: 'calculated-route',
    route: route.routes[0]
});
```

## Advanced Routing Features

### Alternative Routes

Request multiple route options to provide users with choice and flexibility:

```javascript
const routes = await calculateRoute({
    locations: [[4.9041, 52.3676], [2.3522, 48.8566]],
    maxAlternatives: 2 // Returns up to 3 total routes
});

routes.routes.forEach((route, index) => {
    console.log(`Route ${index + 1}: ${route.summary.lengthInMeters}m`);
});
```

### Time-Based Routing

Calculate routes for specific departure times to account for traffic patterns:

```javascript
const futureDate = new Date();
futureDate.setHours(futureDate.getHours() + 2);

const route = await calculateRoute({
    locations: [[4.9041, 52.3676], [2.3522, 48.8566]],
    departAt: futureDate.toISOString(),
    traffic: true
});
```
