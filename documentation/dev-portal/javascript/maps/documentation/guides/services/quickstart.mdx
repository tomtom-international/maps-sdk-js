The Services bundle consists of a set of [GeoJSON](#why-geojson) services for TomTom location APIs and can be used from any JS-based application.

Each service is exposed via typically a stateless function which accepts some parameters.
You call the function with some parameters and get the GeoJSON response back without further side effects.

The SDK services are designed to share as many types between them as possible, both for inputs and outputs.
<br/>

## Why GeoJSON?

* [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) is a widely used standard to encode geographic data structures.
* Having GeoJSON compatibility helps you seamlessly integrate with a large ecosystem of geospatial tools and services.
* Easily readable by both humans and machines.
* Extends JSON, which makes it a perfect choice for JS-based applications.
<br/>

# Where can I use the Services bundle?

**web**
* Search for places, plan routes, fetch geometries and EV charging stations availability.
* Then use the Map bundle to show them on a map and interact with them.

**nodejs**
* Ideal for tooling and back-end processing.
* Geocode address inputs to resolve their full address and position before saving or further processing.
* Reverse geocode coordinates to enrich locations before saving them.

**React Native**
* Access our GeoJSON location services from a single codebase without extra plumbing.

# Set up

1. Configure the project as described in [Project setup guide](/javascript/maps/documentation/overview/project-set-up).
2. Discover which [services you want to use](#available-services) and use them.

# Available services

Explore the different services available in the TomTom SDK:

[**Places:**](/javascript/maps/documentation/guides/services/places/quickstart)

*These are services that enable applications to search for places and their details.*
* [Search](/javascript/maps/documentation/guides/services/places/search) - search for places, brands or categories.
* [Geocoding](/javascript/maps/documentation/guides/services/places/geocoding) - resolve places quickly based on address/location inputs.
* [Reverse geocoding](/javascript/maps/documentation/guides/services/places/reverse-geocoding) - find the nearest address for given coordinates.

[**Routing:**](/javascript/maps/documentation/guides/services/routing/quickstart)

*These are services that enable applications to plan routes.*
* [Routing](/javascript/maps/documentation/guides/services/routing/planning-route) - controls added places on the map.
* [Long distance EV routing](/javascript/maps/documentation/guides/services/routing/long-distance-ev-routing) - controls added geometries on the map.
