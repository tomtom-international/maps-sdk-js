# What is the Core bundle?

The Core bundle is a set of types and utilities common to the SDK map and services and which helps to seamlessly integrate them.

* [Common configuration](/javascript/maps/documentation/api-reference/core.TomTomConfig)
* Common types (such as outputs from Services which can be used as inputs to the Map)
* Utilities (such as distance/duration formatting and bounding box calculations)

# Using the Core Bundle

If you use Map and/or Services, there is no need to install any further packages.\
Code imports from the SDK Core Bundle will come from ```@anw/maps-sdk-js/core```
