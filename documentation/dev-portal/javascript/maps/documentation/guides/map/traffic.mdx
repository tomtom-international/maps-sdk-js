# Traffic Module Overview

The Traffic Module in the TomTom Maps SDK provides comprehensive real-time traffic visualization capabilities that help users understand current road conditions and make informed routing decisions. This module integrates seamlessly with TomTom's global traffic data infrastructure to deliver accurate, up-to-date traffic information through two specialized components.

## Understanding Traffic Components

The TomTom Maps SDK separates traffic functionality into two distinct but complementary modules, each optimized for specific types of traffic information:

### Traffic Incidents Module

The **[Traffic Incidents Module](/javascript/maps/documentation/guides/map/traffic-incidents)** handles specific events that affect road conditions, such as accidents, construction, and weather-related disruptions. This module provides detailed information about what's causing traffic problems and their expected impact.

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Event-specific information** including accidents, road closures, and construction
- **Severity classification** with impact assessment and delay estimates
- **Interactive incident details** through click and hover events
- **Advanced filtering** by incident type, severity, and delay impact

### Traffic Flow Module

The **[Traffic Flow Module](/javascript/maps/documentation/guides/map/traffic-flow)** displays real-time observed speeds and travel times across road networks using intuitive color coding. This module helps users quickly assess overall traffic conditions across large geographic areas.

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Speed visualization** with color-coded indicators (red = slow, green = free flow)
- **Real-time speed data** based on actual observed traffic conditions
- **Comprehensive road coverage** including highways, arterials, and urban streets
- **Advanced filtering** by road type and closure status

## Getting Started with Traffic

### Quick Traffic Integration

The fastest way to add traffic information to your map is through the style configuration:

```javascript
import { TomTomMap } from '@cet/maps-sdk-js/map';

// Enable both traffic incidents and flow
const map = new TomTomMap(
    { container: 'map' },
    {
        style: {
            type: 'published',
            include: ['trafficIncidents', 'trafficFlow']
        }
    }
);
```

### Selective Traffic Data

Choose specific traffic information based on your application needs:

```javascript
// Show only traffic incidents
const incidentMap = new TomTomMap(
    { container: 'incident-map' },
    {
        style: {
            type: 'published',
            include: ['trafficIncidents']
        }
    }
);

// Show only traffic flow
const flowMap = new TomTomMap(
    { container: 'flow-map' },
    {
        style: {
            type: 'published',
            include: ['trafficFlow']
        }
    }
);
```

## Basic Traffic Control

### Working with Traffic Modules

For advanced control over traffic display and behavior, import and initialize the specific modules:

```javascript
import { TrafficIncidentsModule, TrafficFlowModule } from '@cet/maps-sdk-js/map';

// Initialize traffic modules
const incidents = await TrafficIncidentsModule.get(map);
const flow = await TrafficFlowModule.get(map);
```

### Simple Visibility Controls

Implement basic traffic toggle functionality:

```javascript
// Toggle traffic incidents
incidents.setVisible(!incidents.isVisible());

// Toggle traffic flow
flow.setVisible(!flow.isVisible());

// Toggle incident icons independently
incidents.setIconsVisible(!incidents.anyIconLayersVisible());
```

### Combined Traffic Controls

Create unified controls for managing both traffic components:

```javascript
function toggleAllTraffic() {
    const showTraffic = !incidents.isVisible() && !flow.isVisible();
    incidents.setVisible(showTraffic);
    flow.setVisible(showTraffic);
}

function getTrafficStatus() {
    return {
        incidents: incidents.isVisible(),
        flow: flow.isVisible(),
        incidentIcons: incidents.anyIconLayersVisible()
    };
}
```

## Basic Event Handling

### Traffic Incident Interactions

Handle user interactions with traffic incidents:

```javascript
incidents.events.on('click', (feature, lngLat) => {
    console.log('Incident type:', feature.properties.type);
    console.log('Severity:', feature.properties.severity);
    showIncidentDetails(feature.properties);
});
```

### Traffic Flow Interactions

Handle interactions with traffic flow data:

```javascript
flow.events.on('click', (feature, lngLat) => {
    console.log('Road category:', feature.properties.road_category);
    console.log('Current speed:', feature.properties.current_speed);
    showTrafficFlowInfo(feature.properties);
});
```

## Integration with Routing

Traffic data enhances routing decisions by providing real-time road condition information:

```javascript
import { calculateRoute } from '@cet/maps-sdk-js/services';
import { RoutesModule } from '@cet/maps-sdk-js/map';

// Calculate traffic-aware route
const route = await calculateRoute({
    locations: [[4.9041, 52.3676], [2.3522, 48.8566]],
    traffic: true,
    departAt: 'now'
});

// Display route with traffic context
const routesModule = await RoutesModule.get(map);
routesModule.addRoute({
    id: 'traffic-route',
    route: route.routes[0]
});
```

## Common Use Cases

### Navigation Applications
- **Route optimization** using real-time traffic conditions
- **Alternative suggestions** when incidents block planned routes
- **Travel time accuracy** with traffic-adjusted estimates

### Fleet Management
- **Dispatch optimization** based on current traffic patterns
- **Delivery scheduling** considering traffic delays
- **Route monitoring** for commercial vehicle operations

### Urban Planning
- **Traffic pattern analysis** for infrastructure development
- **Event impact assessment** for public gathering planning
- **Transportation policy** informed by traffic data
