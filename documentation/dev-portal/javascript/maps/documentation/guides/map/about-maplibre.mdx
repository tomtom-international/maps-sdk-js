# Why MapLibre?

[MapLibre GL JS](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js-docs/api/) is an Open-source TypeScript library for publishing maps on your website.
It is a very powerful tool to display beautiful maps, add data to them and interact with them.

TomTom's strategy involves using OpenStreetMap data and working with open source communities.
Part of that is officially [supporting MapLibre](https://www.tomtom.com/newsroom/news/tomtom-begins-supporting-maplibre/).

This is why the new TomTom Maps SDK JS uses MapLibre GL JS and builds on top of it.

# How we use MapLibre

The TomTom SDK shares MapLibre as a peer dependency with your application and transparently exposes it.
As soon as you have initialized the TomTom Map, you can access its [`mapLibreMap`](/javascript/maps/documentation/api-reference/map-init.TomTomMap#mapLibreMap)
and start [using it](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js-docs/api/map/#map-instance-members).

MapLibre GL JS is a very powerful tool, but:
* It's generic: you can imagine it like a powerful swiss army knife to display maps of multiple sources and types
* Maps are rich and complex, particularly when you involve dynamic data and user interaction

This is why the TomTom SDK focuses on leveraging MapLibre to help you integrate a TomTom map and TomTom services in your application,
while giving you direct access to the full power of MapLibre if you want it.

The TomTom SDK makes it easy to display the latest TomTom Map with the style and configuration you need, display places, routes and geometries on it,
change configuration and data at runtime, and interact with them with a powerful out-of-the-box event system.
It does all that by connecting MapLibre to the TomTom map data and services for you.

You can also display your own data on top of the TomTom map through its SDK modules, or via MapLibre directly.
