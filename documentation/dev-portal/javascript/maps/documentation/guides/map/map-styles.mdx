# About TomTom map styles
This section explains what map styles are and which are the main TomTom styles and parts.

## What is a map style
A map style is used to define the look and feel of a map. It’s written in JSON format and specifies how to:
*   Load the map data, specifying **data sources** and their URLs.
*   Define **how the data should look like** by defining layers for the different data sources:
    *   Style the symbols, lines, polygons, background, hill shading, heatmap points, raster tiles, circles, and extruded polygons.
    *   Specify which of them should be drawn.
    *   Set the order in which to draw them.

>The detailed structure of a map style is described in the [Map Style Specification](https://developer.tomtom.com/map-display-api/documentation/mapstyles/map-style-specification).

Different applications may require different styles, so map visualisation can be aligned with brand identity or with specific use cases.
For example, the map in a tourist app will show POIs like museums and restaurants, while a truck navigation app will include road shields and height restrictions.
The TomTom Map can load multiple pre-defined styles, but it also supports loading custom ones.
<br/>

## TomTom map style parts
A TomTom map, which is styled using the specification mentioned above, consists of a small set of key parts.
Such parts can be used in different combinations to display a map that suits your needs.

The SDK lets you decide what parts to add to the style, and lets you control them with a map module for each part.
<br/>

### Base Map
The Base Map is the most fundamental part of the style.
It defines the main vector tiles source and all the layers for it, which display, in a nutshell:
* the map geometries: land, water, urban areas, parks, buildings...
* the road network: road lines, road shields, street and road labels
* labels for towns, cities and countries.

The base map is always included when loading the style, and can be further controlled with the
[Base Map Module](/javascript/maps/documentation/guides/map/base-map).

### POIs
The POIs style part enables the display of points of interest on the map, such as restaurants, parking, charging stations, schools, hospitals, public transport, and so on.

The style part and its underlying data determines how the different POI categories are displayed, giving each category a relative priority.

POIs can be optionally included when loading the style and can be further controlled with the
[POIs Module](/javascript/maps/documentation/guides/map/pois)

>The POI style part is also needed for the default behaviour of the [Places Module](/javascript/maps/documentation/guides/map/places)

### Traffic Incidents
The Traffic Incidents style part enables the display of traffic jams and incidents around the road network.

The style part and its underlying data determine how the different incidents are displayed, giving each type and severity a relative priority.

Traffic Incidents can be optionally included when loading the style and can be further controlled with the
[Traffic Incidents Module](/javascript/maps/documentation/guides/map/traffic-incidents)

>The Traffic Incidents style part is also needed for the default display of [traffic along routes](/javascript/maps/documentation/guides/routes)

### Traffic Flow
The Traffic Flow style part enables the display of real time observed speeds and travel times for all key roads in the road network.

The style part and its underlying data determine how the different flow segments are displayed, giving each type and severity a relative priority.

Traffic Incidents can be optionally included when loading the style and can be further controlled with the
[Traffic Flow Module](/javascript/maps/documentation/guides/map/traffic-flow)
<br/>

## Pre-defined styles and variants
The Map bundle provides access to TomTom pre-defined styles that can be used in your application.
They are provided in the [`StyleInput`](/javascript/maps/documentation/api-reference/map-init#StyleInput) as [`PublishedStyle`](/javascript/maps/documentation/api-reference/map-init#PublishedStyle).
A [`PublishedStyle`](/javascript/maps/documentation/api-reference/map-init#PublishedStyle) represents a style which is officially hosted by TomTom and easily accessible by its name.

Each pre-defined style may also have `variants` which are different versions of the look and feel for different contexts, such as day and night.

The available [`published styles`](/javascript/maps/documentation/api-reference/map-init#PublishedStyle) and variants are:
* `standardLight` and `standardDark` - Styles made for browsing the map in light and dark mode respectively. `standardLight` is the default style.
* `monoLight` and `monoDark` - Styles made for browsing the map in black and white, emphasizing color content added on top.
* `drivingLight` and `drivingDark` - Styles to use during navigation in light and dark mode respectively.
* `satellite` - This style uses satellite imagery to draw the map.

You can try these styles in the [Map Config Playground](https://hosted-examples.maps-sdk-js.tomtom.com/main/map-config-playground/).
<br/>

# Loading styles

## Initializing the map with a style
When you initialize a TomTomMap, it will use the `standardLight` style by default.
However, you can specify a different style if you want.

A map style can be loaded when the map is initialized by specifying the `style` property of
the [`TomTomMapParams`](/javascript/maps/documentation/api-reference/map-init#TomTomMapParams) when initializing
an instance of [`TomTomMap`](/javascript/maps/documentation/api-reference/map-init.TomTomMap).
```javascript
import { TomTomMap } from "@anw/maps-sdk-js/map";
const map = new TomTomMap(
    { container: "map" },
    { style: "standardDark" }
);
```

This is useful when you want to change the style at runtime. MapLibre will help with transitioning from the current to the new style smoothly.
<br/>

## Including parts in a style
When setting the map style, you can include parts into it with the `include` property in [`TomTomMapParams`](/javascript/maps/documentation/api-reference/map-init#TomTomMapParams).
For example, including [pois](/javascript/maps/documentation/guides/map/pois) and [traffic incidents](/javascript/maps/documentation/guides/map/traffic_incidents):

```javascript
import { TomTomMap } from "@anw/maps-sdk-js/map";
const map = new TomTomMap(
    { container: "map" },
    { style: { type: "published", include: ["poi", "traffic_incidents"] }}
);
```
<br/>

### Loading style parts as you need them
You can initialize a map without some style parts in it, and choose to add them later on as you need them.
For instance, you can initialize just a basic map, and later on add POIs to it, or initialize it with POIs but add traffic later to it.

If you don't need some style parts on startup, this has the main benefit of helping with the **map loading faster upfront**.

To load a style part later:
* Do not include it when initializing the map
* Load it later by initializing its respective module with `ensureAddedToStyle` parameter set to true
```javascript
import { TomTomMap } from "@anw/maps-sdk-js/map";
import { TrafficIncidentsModule } from "@anw/maps-sdk-js/map";
const map = new TomTomMap(
    { container: "map" },
    { style: { type: "published", include: ["poi"] }}
);
// This will automatically reload the style with traffic incidents in it while preserving previous SDK state:
const incidents = TrafficIncidentsModule.get(map, { ensureAddedToStyle: true });
```

>If the style has been reloaded, how do we keep what was added to it beforehand?
You can learn more about that [here](#preserving-state-after-changing-the-style)
<br/>

## Changing a map style at runtime
You can change the style of the map at runtime using the [`setStyle`](/javascript/maps/documentation/api-reference/map-init.TomTomMap#setStyle) method on the TomTomMap class.
```javascript
map.setStyle("monoLight");
```

### Preserving state after changing the style
During the application runtime, many things can change from the initial loaded style:
* Existing style layers might have changed filters and visibilities.
* New sources and layers might have been added.

The changes above are applied to the ongoing loaded style. When a new style is loaded in MapLibre, such changes are removed. So how to restore them?

**All the changes done via SDK modules are restored automatically via the SDK.**

If you have changes done to the map using MapLibre directly, you need to listen to style changes and restore them yourself.
```javascript
map.addStyleChangeHandler(() => console.log("TomTomMap setStyle was invoked"));
```

You can opt out from automatically restoring state when changing style with the `keepState` parameter:
```javascript
map.setStyle("monoLight", false);
```

# Customizing a style with Map Styler
You can also create your own style to suit your application.

<Blockquote hasIcon>
    The easiest way to do this is to use [Map Styler](https://developer.tomtom.com/maps-api/map-styler). It provides a user interface with real-time previews so you can see the effects of your changes.

Custom styles can be provided to the application in the [`StyleInput`](/javascript/maps/documentation/api-reference/map-init#StyleInput)
as a [`CustomStyle`](/javascript/maps/documentation/api-reference/map-init#CustomStyle).
