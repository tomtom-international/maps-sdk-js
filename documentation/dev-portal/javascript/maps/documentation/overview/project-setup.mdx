# Requesting your API key
To use **Maps SDK JS** in your application you need to obtain a TomTom API key by following [these instructions](https://developer.tomtom.com/how-to-get-tomtom-api-key).
**Remember to keep your API key secure.**
<br/>

# Installing dependencies with NPM
We recommend using [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) to manage your project dependencies.

Before you start: [install npm 9+](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

In your project root, install the Maps SDK JS dependency:
```shell
npm i @anw/maps-sdk-js
```

Additionally:
* If you use the [*map*](/javascript/maps/documentation/guides/map/quickstart), ensure to have [maplibre-gl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/maplibre-gl) installed:
```shell
npm i maplibre-gl
```
<br/>

# TomTomConfig: the SDK global configuration
The TomTom SDK comes with a global configuration singleton object where you can set common parameters to both maps and services.
You only need to set the global parameters once in your code, and the SDK will then inject them into any map and services you use.

Importing the global config:
```javascript
import { TomTomConfig } from "@anw/maps-sdk-js/core";
```
<br/>

# Setting your API key in the SDK
Once you have obtained your API key, you can set it once in your global config via the ```apiKey``` property:
```javascript
TomTomConfig.instance.put({ apiKey: YOUR_KEY });
```
<br/>

# Setting a language in the SDK
The map and services in TomTom support multiple languages.

If you don't use any language, the SDK will resolve the languages depending on what you use:
* The map switches to NGT (Neutral Ground Truth) where each map location follows its regional language
* The services will attempt to match the language to your query, or default to English.

```javascript
TomTomConfig.instance.put({ language: "en-US", apiKey: YOUR_KEY });
```
<br/>

### (Using multiple API keys)
We recommend using a single API key in your application, but in some cases you might want to have multiple,
particularly if they have different settings.

In that case, your global configuration ```apiKey``` can be optional or used as a default parameter,
while you can pass a custom ```apiKey``` when creating the map or calling each service.

Check the [map](/javascript/maps/documentation/guides/map/quickstart) and [services](/javascript/maps/documentation/guides/services/quickstart) guides for more details.
