# TomTom Maps SDK JS

**Maps SDK JS** is a **JavaScript/TypeScript** library for building applications using [**TomTom** location maps and services](https://developer.tomtom.com/).

<a href="https://latest.examples.maps-sdk-js.tomtom.com">
    <img src="images/sdk-examples-collage.png" style={{width: "800px"}} alt="Example Thumbnails"/>
</a>

It leverages the power of [MapLibre GL JS](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js) and [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/)
to seamlessly integrate TomTom maps and services with convenient out-of-the-box support, while staying highly customizable and extensible.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Maps**: MapLibre-powered library for styled, service-compatible TomTom Maps
- **Comprehensive Services**: Access to TomTom's location APIs including search, routing, and geocoding
- **GeoJSON Support**: Built-in compatibility with the widely-used geospatial data format
- **TypeScript Ready**: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions
- **Modular Architecture**: Use only the features you need with tree-shaking support

## Where can you run it?

- **Web**: Display and configure maps, search for places, plan routes, and interact with location data
- **Node.js**: Server-side geocoding, route calculation, and data enrichment capabilities
- **React Native**: Leverage TomTom location services from a single codebase

## Bundles

The Maps SDK is made up of three main bundles:

-   [**Map**](/javascript/maps/documentation/guides/map/quickstart): MapLibre-powered library for interactive TomTom Maps with modules for places, routes, traffic, and more.
-   [**Services**](/javascript/maps/documentation/guides/services/quickstart): GeoJSON services for TomTom location APIs: search, routing, geocoding, EV charging availability, and geometry data.
-   [**Core**](/javascript/maps/documentation/guides/core/quickstart): Shared configuration, types, and utilities used across Map and Services bundles.

Each bundle is designed to work independently or together, allowing developers to use only the features they need with optimized bundle sizes.
