# TomTom Maps SDK JS

**Maps SDK JS** is a **JavaScript/TypeScript** library for building applications using [**TomTom** location maps and services](https://developer.tomtom.com/).


<a href="https://latest.examples.maps-sdk-js.tomtom.com">
    <img src="images/sdk-examples-collage.png" style={{width: "800px"}} alt="Example Thumbnails"/>
</a>

It leverages the power of [MapLibre GL JS](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js) and [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/)
to seamlessly integrate TomTom maps and services with convenient out-of-the-box support, while staying highly customizable and extensible.
<br/><br/>

# Where can you run it on?
- **web**: display and configure a map, search for places, plan routes, and easily display and interact with them, including your own data
- **nodejs**: (reverse)geocode locations, (re)calculate routes, and more, to enrich data before saving or returning it
- **React Native**: leverage the power of TomTom location services from a single codebase
<br/><br/>

# Bundles
The Maps SDK is made up of three bundles:
-   [**Map**](/javascript/maps/documentation/guides/map/quickstart): MapLibre-powered library for readily styled, service-compatible and interactive TomTom Maps.
-   [**Services**](/javascript/maps/documentation/guides/services/quickstart): GeoJSON services for TomTom location APIs: search for places, calculate routes, EV charging availability, and more.
-   [**Core**](/javascript/maps/documentation/guides/core/quickstart): configuration, types and utilities common to Map and Services.

Each bundle comes with its own modules and functions. Developers can use only the code features they need, with out-of-the-box or configured solutions, or their own implementations.
