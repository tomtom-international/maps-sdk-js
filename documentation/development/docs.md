## Documentation requirements and design

Maps SDK JS documentation consists of two kinds of documentation:
- guides (static)
- API reference (dynamic)

The team writes the guides manually (with collaboration of technical writers in the end).
The API reference is generated by [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/) from the Typescript comments in the source code,
using community-maintained plugins.
Typedoc is extensible and supports a variety of configurations and (community-maintained) plugins.

### Developer portal

An important requirement for the documentation is the ability to host the documentation on the 
[TomTom developer portal](https://developer.tomtom.com). Most of the choices and work around documentation are based on 
this requirement. At the time of writing, the developer portal content is written in Markdown (MDX to be exact). So we 
should deliver Markdown (or MDX) content to the developer portal. The guides and API reference are both delivered as 
MDX files.

## Challenges of documentation

Writing documentation in our current setup comes with challenges. A big challenge in general is our dependency on 
external products (developer portal, typedoc, typedoc plugins). Developer portal should provide us with tools for hosting 
API reference on their platform, like documentation versioning, convenient components for API reference types. However, 
hosting API references is a new concept, and some of these tools are not available yet at the time of writing. The 
following subsections highlight challenging areas around guides and API reference respectively. These challenges are 
meant to give you an idea of why we have written things the way they are.

### Challenges with guides
The main challenge around the guides comes with their static nature.
Guides are written by team members and will need maintenance as the SDK evolves.
This means updating the guides when functionality changes or new functionality gets added.
But smaller changes will need maintenance as well, like updating hyperlinks pointing to the API reference, 
when a type is renamed.
The goal is to automate as many of these problems as possible and many of these problems are still work-in-progress.

### Challenges with API reference
As mentioned before, the API reference is generated by Typedoc. Typedoc renders its output to HTML files by default, 
but developer portal needs Markdown files. To generate Markdown files, we make use of [typedoc-plugin-markdown](https://github.com/tgreyuk/typedoc-plugin-markdown/tree/master/packages/typedoc-plugin-markdown).
This plugin didn't fit our use-case completely: we wanted to use components defined by the developer portal and change
the output to look better on the developer portal. So we have extended and customized the plugin, see
the [maps-sdk-theme](../maps-sdk-theme) directory.

In general, customizing Typedoc and typedoc-plugin-markdown to fit our requirements has been a big task.

## Getting started on documentation development

Documentation is located in the [dev-portal](../dev-portal) folder. It contains static files written by the team and 
API reference files generated by Typedoc.
* The static files are located in the [guides](../dev-portal/javascript/maps/documentation/guides) and [overview](../dev-portal/javascript/maps/documentation/guides) folders.
* The API reference files are located in the [api-reference](../dev-portal/javascript/maps/documentation/api-reference) folder inside the documentation folder, and they are **not included** in git.

The autogenerated files are created with:
```shell
npm run documentation
```
Note that this will remove the existing files from the api-reference folder and generate new documents.

**Before** the documentation is generated we need to manually do one step:
- Make sure that all main files, which should be visible in the devportal navigation side menu, are in the
[`base-navigation.yml`](../dev-portal/web/maps/documentation/navigation.yml) file. All the extra files are automatically added when generating the documentation.

The [javascript](../dev-portal/javascript/) subfolder should be tested using [drumkit monorepo project](https://github.com/tomtom-international/drumkit-monorepo)
and committed to [dev-portal documentation](https://github.com/tomtom-international/devportal-documentation) when ready.
