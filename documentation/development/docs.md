title: Generating documentation

<a style="display: block; margin: 0; padding: 0;" name="_docs"></a>

Documentation is located in the [documentation](./documentation) folder. It contains static files written by team and [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/) files autogenerated from the code comments.
* The static files are located in the [documentation](./documentation) folder.
* The autogenerated files are located in the [api-reference](./documentation/api-reference) folder inside documentation folder, and they are **not included** in git.
---
The whole folder should be tested using [monorepo project](https://github.com/tomtom-international/drumkit-monorepo) and committed to [dev-portal](https://github.com/tomtom-international/devportal-documentation) when ready.
