title: Generating documentation
---

<a style="display: block; margin: 0; padding: 0;" name="_docs"></a>

---
Documentation is located in the [documentation](./documentation) folder. It contains static files written by team and [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/) files autogenerated from the code comments.
* The static files are located in the [documentation](./documentation) folder.
* The autogenerated files are located in the [api-reference](./documentation/api-reference) folder inside documentation folder, and they are **not included** in git.
---
After the documentation is generated we need to manually do two steps:
- Make sure that all the files generated are in [navigation](./documentation/navigation.yml) list, only the main ones should not be hidden
- Run find/replace on whole api-reference folder and replace ".md" with ""
---
The whole folder structure except development subfolder should be tested using [monorepo project](https://github.com/tomtom-international/drumkit-monorepo)
and committed to [dev-portal](https://github.com/tomtom-international/devportal-documentation) when ready.
