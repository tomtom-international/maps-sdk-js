title: Generating documentation
---

<a style="display: block; margin: 0; padding: 0;" name="_docs"></a>

---
Documentation is located in the [dev-portal](../dev-portal) folder. It contains static files written by team and [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/) files autogenerated from the code comments.
* The static files are located in the [dev-portal](../dev-portal) folder.
* The autogenerated files are located in the [api-reference](../dev-portal/web/maps/documentation/api-reference) folder inside documentation folder, and they are **not included** in git.

The autogenerated files are created with:
```shell
npm run documentation
```
Note that this will remove the existing files from the api-reference folder and generate new documents.

---
**Before** the documentation is generated we need to manually do one step:
- Make sure that all main files, which should be visible in the devportal navigation side menu, are in the
[`base-navigation.yml`](../dev-portal/web/maps/documentation/navigation.yml) file. All the extra files are automatically added when generating the documentation.
---
The whole folder structure except development subfolder should be tested using [monorepo project](https://github.com/tomtom-international/drumkit-monorepo)
and committed to [dev-portal documentation](https://github.com/tomtom-international/devportal-documentation) when ready.
